# AuctionApp
Team project for Accenture bootcamp


AuctionApp is an online auction platform that allows users to buy
and sell various items through an auction-style bidding system and have positive environmental benefits:

**_Reduction of Waste:_**
By enabling users to resell their items instead of discarding them, the auction app helps to extend the lifecycle of products. This directly reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, contributing to a more sustainable waste management approach.

**_Energy and Resource Conservation:_**
Manufacturing new products consumes resources and energy. By encouraging the reuse of existing items, the auction app helps conserve natural resources and reduce the energy required for production.

**_Consumer Awareness_**
The app can raise awareness among users about the environmental impact of their consumption habits. As users actively participate in reselling and purchasing second-hand items, they may become more conscious of their choices and their role in sustainable consumption.

**_Support for Sustainable Practices:_**
Auction app encourage the sale of sustainable, eco-friendly, or locally made products can further promote sustainable consumer behavior and contribute to a greener lifestyle.
